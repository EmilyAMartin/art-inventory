## Project Overview

Portfolio is a website I developed to help artists and creators catalog their work while also offering inspiration from other artists. The platform features several key pages:
Artwork Page: Allows users to organize and catalog their own artworks.
Gallery Page: Users can browse and save artworks from the Art Institute of Chicago, utilizing their open API.
Accounts Page: Enables users to create and manage personal profiles and accounts.
In Module 3, I will be focusing on developing the sign-up, login, and artwork upload features. Additionally, I plan to introduce a new page that allows users to upload project ideas. This feature will enable users to upload color palettes, images, sketches, and notes to inspire future projects.

## Motivation

This project was inspired by my personal need for a platform to catalog my own artworks. I wanted to create a space where I, as well as other creators, could easily document their artworks, search for inspiration and brainstorm ideas all in one unified platform.

## Key Features

Search for inspiration using the Art Institute of Chicago's API.
